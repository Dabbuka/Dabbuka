# About Me
I’m Luca Tineo, second year at UCLA. I took an interest in computer science in senior year of high school and committed to pursuing it as a career in my freshman year of college. It's a bumpy ride but I'm looking forward to seeing it through!
Currently, I've taken an interest in multiple different sectors of the computer science world and am currently working on building my basic skills and exploring the branches I find most compelling. At the moment, I am learning HTML, CSS, and JS for WebDev and C++ in university classes.
At the moment I am still just a beginner, but I plan on quickly changing that.
